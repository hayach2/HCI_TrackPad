- heatmap : color code the performance, green is the trackpad & red for direct touch
- why are we doing both and not just trackpad: cause it should not replace the direct touch, it should be an additionak
- randomize tests : is it because task 10 is hard or it’s cause they’re bored
- make 27 tasks, and choose random 15 out of them 3 bbig, 3 medium, 3 small
- Pseudo-random (where the participant has tried small medium and big logo size)
- Control the initial position (fermer or the start. buffer screen before each test) amplitude
- add border to logo target
- questionnaire



Analysis:
- learning curveL plot the min time taken foreach task
- model fitts law on your data: start point before the tests

future work:
- display trackpad on demand
